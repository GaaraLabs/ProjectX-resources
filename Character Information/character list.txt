A few years ago, there lived a peaceful family, in the small town of <town name>. Until one day, it all went up in the flames. The fire not only burned on the ruins of the city, but also in the hearts of the two unfortunate siblings. Not long ago, their father signed up for the military program and left their city, they cried for him to stop, they wanted him to be there, for they were scared, but little did they knew, that he left for good. A week passed and when
no one was around, the city was under siege, people were killed, houses were demolished and few who surrendered, were taken hostage. Our tale revolves
around 2 of them. Actually, they were 3, but the eldest one, the one most important to the siblings,the one responsible for bringing them to this world,
was slain. Right in front of their eyes, was laying down their mother's corpse. At that day, the siblings resolved one thing, and that, was to avenge their mother, it was to take revenge from the one who could have protected them, the one who failed them. They both signed up for the military program in the nation that kept them hostage, they were ready to betray their own land, for they were brainwashed by the country, unnecessary it might have been, cause either way
they were coming back, to kill the one who could have protected them, the one who failed them...

The younger of the two unfortunate siblings, reffered to as Surge soon after a few years of his service as a surgeon in the military. Doesn't speak much, or maybe just doesn't get the opportunity due to her fierce sister. The more mature of the two, who handles things peacefully, but still, the agonising sight of his mother haunts him deep inside, begging him to avenger her, begging him to get her revenge...

In recent religious texts, there's a frequent mention of a young man, that went by the name of Valak. He lost many things in this cold world, his family to cultists, his sister to his own brethren and his humanity to the world. When he was very young, his family died at the hands of cultists, he wasn't left unscathed either. They took him and put a price tag on his head. After all, for some, human lives are one of the cheapest things, the world has to offer. Already traumatized, the poor kid worked hard, and then finally, a ray of light appeared in front of him, a new hope, a new possibility... He thought his life finally changed when the assassins of a now forbidden clan rescued him, gave him a better living and trained him to be a better human, a better fighter. A few years of happiness passed by, far from the war taking place in the rest of the world. Deep inside a forest, he was living the life of a monk. Until one day, he was confronted by the harsh truth. Even his new home, his new family, wasn't much different, from the people who slaughtered his actual one. He wanted to revolt, he wanted to leave, but was held hostage, the throat of his new sister pressed against the thinnest of the blades. He pleaded, begged for her life, accepted their conditions, but it was all in vain. Another blow to his already weak and wounded soul enraged him, leaving him with an empty body. He had no feelings, not anymore. He was determined to not get close to anyone, to not let anyone get close to him, and in turn, for anyone to earn his trust. After that day, each and every fight he was a part of, left none but one man alive... Slowly making his way out into the bigger and possible a worse world, he wouldn't let his guard down. He has now joined the military, expecting to not be accountable for anyone but his own life, but he might just be held accountable for... for his opponents'.

Lost his parents early in his life, doesn't like to speak of it though. Sympathy disgusts him, and so did foolishness. Tyran was the most mature kid in Exodius High, maybe 'kid' isn't even the right word for him. Seeing the real world much before his classmates, he couldn't stand their foolishness and wanted to educate them, to make them stronger and independant. But his ways weren't perfect. His rude behavious made him sound like a bully. Even before he could correct anyone, they'd move far away from him. But there was one, the most foolish one according to him, who may just have been the most intelligent, to let him in, into her life, into her heart. Ever since, he had been stalking her, following her every move. He says he doesn't know why, but his behavious does make it pretty obvious.

About a decade ago, a huge explosion took place, memorised by many, for the loss, for the millions of people who lost their lives, as it marked the most deaths to ever occur due to an accident. A usual day it was, for Doctor Edwin, until an alarm went off, throughout the biggest research laboratory known to mankind, one terrifying enough to send shivers down the spine just by thinking of it. It was an alarm that could only be activated through the top floor, the top secret.
The secret which put people to shame after it's discovery. The scientists there used living humans as guinea pigs, feeding them chemicals they never knew existed, trying to mutate them, push them past their abilities, and then, one went berserk... Thrashing everything in his path, he bashed open the skulls of many scientists working there. A sight of complete chaos filled the hearts of those alive with horror. One by one they died, screaming, begging for help as all the workers in the lab rushed out, pushing and trampling each other. On the other hand, Doctor Edwin rushed in, trying to run past the crowd that kept pushing him away from his destination. At that moment, he realised, that an eerie silence had filled the air, followed by a huge blast. The lab was in ruins, nothing left of it apart from the ground floor and ruins of their research. Weird chemicals rained down on those who managed to survive, having quite an opposite effect. The government had to shamelessly disband the project, and rehabilitate the once who suffered, employ the ones who worked there. And so, the unlucky doctor was sent to the military, part of which was his own request, to payback the debt he owed to humanity

Around 3PM, in an unfortunate household, there rang a bell, from the one whom the household cursed from the bottom of it's heart. The stern voice of the military officer on the other side of the line accompanied by an uneasy silence laid the foundation of a bad news, which then stuck the reciever at the bottom of her heart, sending shivers down her whole body. A huge explosion had taken place on the other side of the border, vapourasing almost everyone who was near center. One of which happened to be a war criminal, treated worse than an animal. Tortured and experimented upon. The people considered already dead by their loved ones begged for their death. but were given a worse experience in their lives. Though the deaths affected people on both sides, some forgave it in the name of science, but others could not. One such induvidual from the later of the two groups was Laura. She worked as a nurse, healing those who were wounded, her husband on the other hand, took lives, in the frontlines... until one day he was on the brink of losing his own, he was saved, but not by his own people.
And soon met his demise in worse circumstances. Anyone else might be depressed, but not her, she resolved to join the army, swore in her heart to not leave anyone else wounded, begging for help, or wanting to die... the way her husband did.

The war has been going on for quite a few years now, decades perhaps. And over the course of time, the sufferings have only been increasing. The innocent public tries to ignore it, or are made to... forcefully. Instead they talk about the greatness of the people who laid their lives for the country. Chris Dane was such an amalgam of both, but not, at the same time. Blamed for the death of his comrades, the failure of the mission he was the head of, triggered a massive blow to his reputation, even questioning his loyality and exiling him in the name of treason. After all this, the people didn't see his suffering but only as a failure and burden compared to the great martyrs. His daughter though, was the only person to not question his decisions. Giving her best at everything she can, to redeem her father, his integrity. Even after many years, those who recognise her relation with the one titled a disgrace to the nation, degrade her. Years of humiliation has filled her heart with hatred. After finishing her studies as an honour student, she wasted no time and aimed straight for her target, joining the military and looking for a chance. A chance to prove her family's devotion to her nation.
