Exodius High, an average military school is where the origins of yet another two characters takes place. Met due to destiny or not, their destinies are now intertwined. The day they left the campus, proved to be a turning point in their lives. Due to shortage of men, young graduates had to leave their studies and risk their lives for their motherland. Although some had these ruthless experiences in their lives already, most did not. From total novices to high respected officers, their lives were not easy, though easy it was, for the ones who left early. The ones who left for good. And among these young children, two names that standout the most, are those of Emily and Tyran. One known to save lives, while the other to end them.

Lost his parents early in his life, doesn't like to speak of it though. Sympathy disgusts him, and so did foolishness. Tyran was the most mature kid in Exodius High, maybe 'kid' isn't even the right word for him. Seeing the real world much before his classmates, he couldn't stand their foolishness and wanted to educate them, to make them stronger and independant. But his ways weren't perfect. His rude behavious made him sound like a bully. Even before he could correct anyone, they'd move far away from him. But there was one, the most foolish one according to him, who may just have been the most intelligent, to let him in, into her life, into her heart. Ever since, he had been stalking her, following her every move. He says he doesn't know why, but his behavious does make it pretty obvious.
